# DALLE2Textures
## What is this?
Uses OpenAI's API to interface with DALL-E 2. 
It loops through all files, and checks if they are in a directory we want to replace. 
It then asks DALL-E 2 to generate an image. Then it writes it back to a new pack.

## EXCEPTIONS:
Many things have not been retextured. These include
- Animated textures (Never)
- Complex/stitched textures (Never)
- Extended / Long textures (Never)
- Chiseled Deepslate

Wait, what? Yeah. It was, for some reason, flagged by the OpenAI safety system.

Couldn't you just generate it online? No. Craiyon / DALL-E Mini is a separate model trained on a smaller dataset that cannot create as high detail textures.
- Crimson Stem Top

Same as above

- GUI elements (Never
- Particles (Later)
- Fonts

I don't even know how that would work

- Paintings (Later)
- Sun (Maybe later)
- Moon (Never, it's animated)
- Map (Maybe later)
